# Blockchain-Interoperability
Two blockchain classes are created using python programming language and both blockchains are connected, one of which acts as a public blockchain while the other one is a private blockchain in which data stored by one blockchain is being accessed by another blockchain i.e, concept of blockchain interoperability is being implemented for this problem.  For the sake of simplicity, we are using the POSTMAN application for API testing. We will connect our blockchains through POSTMAN and then various processes like adding information of patients, mining block , accessing chain will take place.   The information of patients that we are going to add in our block is being taken from a dataset, which is obtained from kaggle ( Large online community of data scientists ).
